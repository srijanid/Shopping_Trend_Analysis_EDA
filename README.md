- How does the average purchase amount vary across different product categories?  
- Which gender has the highest number of purchases?  
- What are the most commonly purchased items in each category?  
- Are there specific months or seasons where customer spending is higher?

- How does the presence of a discount influence purchasing decisions?  
- What is the relationship between customer demographics and shopping preferences?
